title: No rollback strategy detected

description: >
  No explicit rollback strategy was detected in deployment configuration.

why_it_matters:
  - Most incidents are resolved by rollback, not by hotfix.
  - Hotfixes under pressure often introduce secondary failures.
  - If rollback is slow or impossible, MTTR explodes.

signals:
  missing:
    - versioned_artifacts
    - deployment_strategy

detect:
  none_of:
    - k8s_deployment_strategy: RollingUpdate
    - ci_contains: rollback
    - artifact_versioning: immutable

confidence: medium
