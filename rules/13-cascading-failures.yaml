title: Potential cascading failure risk detected

description: >
  No evidence of fault-tolerance patterns such as retries or circuit breakers
  was found in the codebase.

why_it_matters:
  - Without retries, transient network failures or brief service outages cause immediate errors.
  - Without circuit breakers, a slow or failing dependency can cause resources to hang, leading to cascading failures across the system.
  - These patterns are essential for maintaining availability in distributed systems.
