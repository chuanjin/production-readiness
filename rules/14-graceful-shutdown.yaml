title: No graceful shutdown handling detected

description: >
  No evidence of graceful shutdown handling (e.g., SIGTERM/SIGINT signal handling)
  was found in the codebase.

why_it_matters:
  - When a system terminates a process (e.g., during deployment or scaling), it sends a SIGTERM.
  - If the application doesn't handle this signal, it may terminate abruptly, dropping in-flight requests.
  - Graceful shutdown allows the application to finish active work, close database connections, and exit cleanly.
