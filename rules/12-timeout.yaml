title: No explicit timeout configuration detected

description: >
  No evidence of timeout configuration was found for network operations,
  HTTP clients, or database connections.

why_it_matters:
  - Missing timeouts can cause resource exhaustion when dependencies are slow or unresponsive.
  - Threads or connections may hang indefinitely, blocking other requests.
  - Cascading failures occur when one slow service affects all callers.
  - Recovery becomes difficult as resources are tied up waiting.
