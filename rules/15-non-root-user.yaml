title: Container likely running as root

description: >
  No non-root user configuration was detected in the Dockerfile.
  Running containers as root is a security risk.

why_it_matters:
  - Containers running as root have elevated privileges on the host if they break out.
  - Many security policies (like OpenShift or restricted Pod Security Standards) 
    disallow running as root.
  - Specifying a non-root user (e.g., `USER 1000`) is a core security best practice.
