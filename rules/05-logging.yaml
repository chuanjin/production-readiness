title: Logging without structure or correlation id

description: >
  Logs appear unstructured or lack correlation identifiers.

why_it_matters:
  - Incident analysis requires reconstructing request timelines.
  - Plain text logs do not scale beyond trivial systems.
  - Missing correlation ids make distributed tracing impossible.

detect:
  any_of:
    - code_contains: console.log
    - code_contains: println
  none_of:
    - correlation_id_detected: true
    - structured_logging_detected: true
